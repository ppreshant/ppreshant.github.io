In India, there is a recent wave of [digital only news media platforms](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/india_digital_revolution_startups_scoopwhoop_wire_times.php) since the decade of the 2010s, which have captured public limelight during the COVID pandemic, by bringing in much required reports from the ground, including visiting [crematoria](https://www.newslaundry.com/2021/04/27/why-are-journalists-showing-grisly-visuals-of-covid-funerals), some with long [video reports](https://youtu.be/lHWnBU8ZAeo) and hospitals, while piecing together data drive [meta-analyses](https://www.newslaundry.com/2021/07/16/chintan-patel-vivek-kaul-covid-big-data-investigation-second-wave) to challenge the narrative of local and national governments regarding the toll of the pandemic. Newslaundry was one of the early entrants in the digital media space, initially starting out as an online platform to critique the shortcomings of established/legacy media in [2012](https://www.newslaundry.com/2022/02/02/nlat10-join-us-as-we-celebrate-10-years-of-newslaundry), but has expanded ever since into first hand news gathering, which is the crux of journalism. Newslaundry is also unique because it is completely subscriber funded for all its revenue and does not take any advertisements or corporate donations, which is a major feat in a country where people are incredibly frugal with their money. I have subscribed and meticulously followed the weekly podcasts of Newslaundry and their newsreports for just under an year now, that I have developed a relationship with this community. With this newfound act of funding journalism, I have really come to appreciate the cost of gathering, verifying, and putting out facts from the ground and the importance of knowing the _'objective'_ truth. So an attack on the journalistic neutrality of Newslaundry as grounds to ignore it's content in a discussion has got me into writing this article in its defense. Anyway shooting the messenger is an easy way to stop the message right?

If anyone claims that Newslaundry is biased, they should also clarify what alternative they think is unbiased. Because to a boat riding on a fast flowing river, everything on the shore appears to move backwards. If you are on the shore, you would understand that I'm referring to the flow of propaganda which starts from the glaciers of the legacy media, now called [godi media](https://thewire.in/media/the-wire-hindi-two-years), increasingly recognized for surrendering its journalistic ethos and wholeheartedly embracing the lucrative business of marketing and PR for the ruling party and our dear leader. The river is flooded frequently by the the typhoon of [manufactured hate](https://www.newslaundry.com/2022/03/11/the-murky-world-of-prashasak-samiti-meet-bjp-and-adityanaths-social-media-warriors-2) which does not leave any occasion to sow hatred and to the steady drizzle of Islamophobia served in seemingly innocuous forwards in WhatsApp groups done by all trusting everyday individuals, who for some reason are more prone to trusting and forwarding content from an unnamed, faceless author without any citations or verifiability, in a fleeting format of writing whose sole existence is in a message between individuals, than a news organization such as Newslaundry. If you think about it, a WhatsApp forward is the equivalent of taking a newspaper's broadcast, writing it up into individual anonymous letters and forwarding them from peer-to-peer. In this river of propaganda flows away our ability to think and independently reason, to differentiate fact from propaganda. You may call me and Newslaundry biased all you want, but at least we have bothered to make a static website for our opinion pieces, put our names on it and treat our readers as curious people capable of thought and an ability to click on the numerous hyperlinks we have provided as citations.

And note that here, we are talking about bias, it is usually applicable to _opinions, Op-eds, and editorial pieces_. For such pieces of secondary journalism, which collect, curate, summarize and create a coherent narrative of events and larger scale phenomena, bias is unavoidable, but the presence of a bias, and the context for it can be explicitly stated wherever helpful. An easier metric to judge such pieces, before getting into the neutrality debate is to check that it cites a healthy amount of primary literature, wherever specifics are being referenced, including data, quotations etc. Wikipedia's [guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources) great start for identifying such citation guidelines. The key goal is to enable readers to verify key information on their own and to demonstrate that your opinion is synthesized from real facts whose origin can be traced, and not cooked up arbitrarily by the authors imagination. If the organization frequently fails on this metric, then bias or the lack of it matters to nothing at all.

Aside from editorial pieces which are likely to be opinionated, however hard the authors try, I will exhort that Newslaundry, along with a few other digital media organizations such as The Wire, The Quint etc. are the [rare exceptions](https://niemanreports.org/articles/in-india-the-last-few-bastions-of-the-free-press-stand-guard-against-rising-authoritarianism/) providing thoroughly fact checked, public interest relevant, first hand news gathering and reporting among a barrage of propaganda from legacy TV media and most of the print media. But don't take my word for it, pick a recent story of interest to you, and look for first hand reports about the incident from 3 independent sources and compare for yourself. There are two ways to examine if any news organization is biased, 

1. _(compare across time)_ : Look at their editorial stance and reporting standards before the current regime came to power, and see if it was drastically different from current day. Look at the line of stories they wish to cover versus the ones they leave out.
2. _(compare across different media)_ : Pick an incident and check their reporting, on comparison to another media portals and look for blindspots in factual reporting, such as downplaying certain aspects of the incident, or leaving out the versions of one side of actors in the story. 

As a good example, Newslaundry has a [video report](https://www.newslaundry.com/2022/04/07/truth-behind-dalit-mans-murder-over-moustache-and-a-village-bitterly-divided-in-rajasthan) of a dalit man from Barva village in Pali district, Rajasthan, who was lynched allegedly for sporting a moustache, which used to be a status symbol reserved for upper caste groups. In this they fist cover the version of the victims family, which is naturally where one needs to start, then they also record what the community members of the guilty party have to say in the matter. They also go into the discussion of this incident in the state assembly, and the persuasion of the politicians by the community members to cover up the matter. And if there was any police action or arrests, they also deserve a mention along with the content of any first information police reports (FIRs) that were registered in the matter. I believe Newslaundry covers all these aspects in a thorough manner, along with presenting a larger context of friction between the communities and has left it to the audience to judge the _"Truth behind a Dalit man's murder"_

I must also mention the common misconception by clarifying that news reporting should not be confused with opinion making or editorial stance. While it is true that the reader trying to judge the neutrality of a news organization is themselves biased one way or the other, a habitual news consumer from a diversity of sources should be able to distinguish a fact from opinion and would be able to tell real news from doctored news or propaganda.

As bonus pieces, you should consider reading these three excellently argued Newslaundry articles from one of the co-founders, Abhinandan Sekhri. 
- _[An analysis of bias and objectivity in media](https://www.newslaundry.com/2021/12/17/on-bias-objectivity-and-where-newslaundry-falls-on-the-ideological-spectrum)_, which reiterates a defense of Newslaundry's commitment to facts, 
- _[Why does Newslaundry not have an organization wide editorial position](https://www.newslaundry.com/2021/05/31/why-dont-we-have-a-newslaundry-editorial-position)_ since every opinion piece carries the name of the author. 
- [Why editorial stances make no sense](https://www.newslaundry.com/2014/06/28/our-position-on-newslaundry)


And for the sake of full disclosure I will conclude by putting on the record my own biases which definitely have influenced this article -

1. I do believe that it is healthy for any democracy when non governmental organizations, media organizations, citizens collective or any individual citizen for that matter to try and hold power accountable. This approach calls for them to be free enough to question power, hence naturally they would have to be slightly biased against each and every government, or any power centre for that matter including a school principal, company executive, head of the local police station or the head of your apartment's resident association. It is the public which runs the show in a democracy, telling elected representatives what is in their best interest to do and keeping an eye out where they seem to make errors of judgement, by intention or inadvertantly, or favour a handful of interest groups at the expense of the long term interest of the wider public. To phrase it shortly, one should be able to "question everything" in a healthy manner.

2. I consider myself to be socially progressive on various issues which means favouring individual liberty in a wide majority of cases over the sentiments of any social group or of arbitrarily defined collective concepts such as national interest. Considering that the Indian society at large is conservative, it is natural that I would favour the approach where questioning, checks and balances make it harder for majoritarian ideas to become entwined with power to force individuals away from their liberty, in order to confirm to the rest of the society. 

3. Two, being a fiscally progressive market proponent, I believe in favouring progressive taxation, including from corporate elites and the use of tax money to keep up key public services such as water, public food distribution system, subsidized or free primary education and quality healthcare, as means to build long term social capital and a productive population along with path of economic well-being. It is my understanding that welfarism in India has been at loggerheads with market thinking and the leverage of big money from corporations to unilaterally influence policy making means that it is worthwhile to question power, as to the motives and stakeholders behind their policies.
