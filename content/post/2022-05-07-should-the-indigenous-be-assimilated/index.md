Should indigenous peoples be assimilated into modern culture or be left alone on their own terms?
	- Left alone says this article : https://time.com/5466416/survival-international-india-sentinelese-john-allen-chau/

> They choose to have no interaction with mainstream society, often because of the catastrophic violence and disease such contact has brought to their people in the past. It is their choice, and their right.

> We put locks on our doors, and are selective with who we admit to the places we call our own because we wish to minimize risk.

If the tribe decides to be an independent group of people, governed by their own laws, and not a part of the law of the land, what if there is a sub-group that might be treated 
poorly, I don't know if this is true of any tribes but if the tibal women were treated as second class citizens and they would like to force their community by citing the fundamental rights provided by the larger state that they are not a part of, I wonder how the dispute would be settled?

What if these women want to keep some of their customs, such as their divorce procedures but change some of the others?

Idea from reading this excerpt from: _Savaging the Civilized: Verrier Elwin, His Tribals, and India, By Ramachandra Guha_
