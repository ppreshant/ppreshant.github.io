- Masters in Sciences, and Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore


### Interests:

**Research**

I am fascinated by microscopic life forms, with all the things they do and the tremendous potential they offer for us to enhance and add to their their natural functions to make them an integral part in our designs for solving human problems, such as climate change, food security, and energy.

For my research, I genetically engineer bacteria to monitor and record chemical signatures of the kind bacteria produce to communicate their presence to their neighbours of the similar clan, using the paradigm of connecting modules of genes with semi independent function called synthetic biology. My sensor bacteria can record the feature they sense by modifying their DNA at a defined location, thereby creating a hereditary memory passed on through generations. If everything goes right, I will soon be testing this on some wild bacteria isolated from wastewater, which is a big leap from the domesticated lab bacteria we used to test the genetic designs. Such sensors should be incredibly handy for undisturbed monitoring of hard to reach environments (ex- pipes, soil, wastewater), where natural bacteria thrive.

I'm also working tracking bacterial exchange of antibiotic resistance genes with their neighbours, which could cause widespread resistance to the use of antibiotics, by using genetic tools that tag the RNA of the bacteria.

**Other Interests**
Sometimes, I mix up my readings about bacteria and socio-political news and I see game theory like connections between them. For example in directed evolution, when we challenge bacteria to modify their genes to improve our desired function that incidentally allows them to grow better and outcompete others, I cannot help but think about human economies, their competition etc., I wonder what in the bacterial world would be the equivalent of a `social safety net`, `universal basic income`, or a `minimum wage` that might allow some slower bacteria to 'survive' for a few more generations. Maybe this might enable more diversity in the final solutions that the bacteria figure out just like how these policies improve _diversity, equity and inclusion_ in human societies?  

Along with doing the science, I take a deep interest in scientific teaching and implementing visuals to enable broader dissemination of scientific knowledge. I also try to stay informed about the current happenings around me, owing to my childhood habit of my two-hour long sessions reading and underlining all the newspapers from the past week. I like to read about international politics, economics, public health and scientific advances among other things, and have also acquired a recent interest in historical anthropology of the kind in the book _[Guns, Germs and Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel)_. These topics will eventually feature in some of my writings so keep an eye out!

**Hobbies**
I enjoy cooking, trying new cuisines, playing cards, hiking waterfalls, ice skating, skiing and other outdoorsy activities. I have recently taken to podcasts while doing some of the mundane aspects of lab work, here's two that I can recommend - [Lights, Camera, Azadi](https://www.stitcher.com/show/lights-camera-azadi), [Pitchfork economics](https://www.stitcher.com/show/pitchfork-economics-with-nick-hanauer)

Do contact me if you have anything interesting for my microbes to sniff or if you just want to connect about ideas!
