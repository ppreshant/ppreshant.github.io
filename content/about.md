**Interests**:

Research

I am fascinated by microscopic life forms, with all the things they do and the tremendous potential they offer for us to enhance and add to their their natural functions to make them an integral part in our designs for solving human problems, such as climate change, food security, and energy.

For my research, I genetically engineer bacteria to monitor and record chemical signatures of the kind bacteria produce to communicate their presence to their neighbours of the similar clan, using the paradigm of connecting modules of genes with semi independent function called synthetic biology. My sensor bacteria can record the feature they sense by modifying their DNA at a defined location, thereby creating a hereditary memory passed on through generations. If everything goes right, I will soon be testing this on some wild bacteria isolated from wastewater, which is a big leap from the domesticated lab bacteria we created the designs using. Such sensors should be incredibly handy for undisturbed monitoring of hard to reach environments (ex- pipes, soil, wastewater), where natural bacteria thrive.

I'm also working tracking bacterial exchange of antibiotic resistance genes with their neighbours, which could cause widespread resistance to the use of antibiotics, by using genetic tools that tag the RNA of the bacteria.

Do contact me if you have anything interesting for my microbes to sniff!

Other Interests
I take a deep interest in keeping informed about the current happenings around me, owing to my childhood habit of my two-hour long sessions reading and underlining all the newspapers from the past week. I like to read about interational politics, economics, public health and scientific advances among other things.


Hobbies
I enjoy cooking, trying new cuisines, playing cards, hiking waterfalls, ice skating, skiing and other outdoorsy activities. I have recently taken to podcasts while doing some of the mundane aspects of labwork, here's two that I recommend - [Lights, Camera, Azadi](https://www.stitcher.com/show/lights-camera-azadi), [Pitchfork economics](https://www.stitcher.com/show/pitchfork-economics-with-nick-hanauer)
