_to keep track of to-do lists, ideas for articles and changes to be made_

## General blog improvements
- [ ] Add a comments section. See [here](https://clarewest.github.io/blog/post/claps-and-comments-in-blogdown/) for ideas
	- Need to figure out adding `.Site.Params` variable for `commentsrepo`
- [x] Change the way quotes are displayed, could try to copy from another theme? ^[Theme 1]
- [ ] Change favicon : tab display -- make a bacteria or PK?
- [ ] (?) _Change theme, while it is still early. Need to create new website looks like_
	- Good themes: [paper-mod](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/papermod/papermod-features/); 
	- Ok, but distracting: [minimo](https://minimo.netlify.app/)

# Obsidian features
- [x] (obsidian) Enable spellcheck so I can directly edit the index.md files - cleaner view
- [x] Channel screenshots into a good directory by default

Useful plugins
- I LOVE the nomnoml plugin. I use it frequently to make up diagrams. So much faster than in OneNote.
- Word is used to compose documents. Draft copied / forked from obsidian. Mainly because Word integrates so well with Zotero.
- I use Zotero as my reference manager. It is not linked to obsidian. I just copy the full bibliography across as required. I've tried the citation plugin briefly with meh results. I need to investigate further.

## Newslaundry defense
[[content/post/2022-05-02-is-newslaundry-biased/index]](article)
- [x] Polish the about section of the blog, to draw from content on the LS lab website and some stuff about social things and other interests
- [ ] Spell check
- [ ] Ask on the discord server to use the nice image from [here](https://www.newslaundry.com/2021/12/17/on-bias-objectivity-and-where-newslaundry-falls-on-the-ideological-spectrum)
- [ ] Can generalize the article to cover editorial integrity and reference this nice visual from [The Ken](https://the-ken.com/about/)
